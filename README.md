Webanwendungen-SS14
===================

In this Repository you can find the entire code from our project called "Messeanmeldung"

In this project we had to develope a website. This website is developed with JavaScript, HTML, CSS an PHP.

Furthermore we use a HTTPRequest to read JSON Data from a given File and write them into an table.

After we fetched JSON Data we learned how to write JSON Data

This should simulate how to read data from, for example, a database.
